SQL Exercises
====
You should read **all** instructions before you begin the exercise

 1. Create an entity relationship diagram to model a **very simple** Customer Management System (CMS). Your diagram should have several entities, but no more than 10.  Ensure that your relationships are correct and that your entities have attributes that sufficiently describe the entity for the exercise. Your diagram should be submitted in this folder as erd.png.
 2. Create an SQL script to create the schema, entities, and relationships you designed in exercise 1. Please ensure that your SQL will execute on an ANSI compliant RDBMS. This exercise should be submitted in this folder as schema.sql.
 3. Write a PL/SQL function to populate your schema with a few records. Please submit in this folder as pfunc1.sql.
 4. Write a PL/SQL function that accepts input parameters to query your model and return a complete view (including relations) of one entity. Please submit in this folder as pfunc2.sql
 5. Create a new entity that will store an aggregate of data calculated from your model. Create a T/SQL function to calculate the aggregation and store the result in your new entity. Please submit this in a folder as tfunc.sql.
 6. Create an explanation of your thought processes for this exercise in a file stored in this folder called explanation.md
